		<h1>Are Electric Vehicles Viable in 2021?</h1>

		<h2>From 2035, the EU have proposed an effective ban on new fossil-fuel cars.</h2>
		<p>
			The EU have proposed a 55% cut in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2030 and a 100% cut by 2035 <sup><a class="ref">euproposal</a></sup>. This means that new fossil-fuel (and
			hybrid) cars would be unable to be sold within the EU, effectively limiting the market to only sell electric vehicles (EVs). But
			are these cars actually practical and viable to own and run?
		</p>

		<h2>1. Are electric vehicles actually better for the environment?</h2>
		<p>
			Electric cars still produce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: they have manufacture and transport requirements, and that's even before
			the emissions produced by generating the electricity they need to run. With all of that taken into consideration, are they even
			better for the environment? Does it depend on the energy production methods being used?

		<p>
			This chart shows that, on average, electric cars are produce less than 50% of the emissions of conventional vehicles,
			considering the vehicle and battery manufacture emissions, upstream emissions (fuel and electricity production) and the vehicle
			exhaust emissions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Poland and Iceland have been chosen as two extremes of carbon-based energy production, with Poland using 11.4% renewable energy
			and producing 507 grams of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated (gCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh), and
			Iceland using 99.99% renewable energy and producing 28 gCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh. As can be seen, even with a high-carbon energy grid
			like Poland's, the emissions produced are still significantly lower than a conventional vehicle.
