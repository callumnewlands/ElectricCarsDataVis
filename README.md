# Electric Vehicles Data Visualisation
Completed for my [Part 4 Data Visualisation](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/comp6234) course at the University of Southampton

The completed visualisation is available at: [https://callumnewlands.github.io/comp6234-coursework/](https://callumnewlands.github.io/comp6234-coursework/)

The report on my visualisations can be found in ```Report.pdf```

## Prerequisistes

There are no pre-requististes for running the site, however the site should be ran using a web server (e.g. [VSCode Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)) 
to facilitate the loading of data from datasources
